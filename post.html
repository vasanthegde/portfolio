            Have you ever felt ecstasy and melancholy at the same time when you saw a beautiful painting or read a
            poem/literature or watched a movie? <br>
            well in one hand you enjoy and appreciate the art and in another hand you feel guilty, sad for not creating
            a such
            art by yourself.

            Have you ever wished if you could just travel to any random village or town. <br>
            Sit and watch all the people go by their day to day life. <br>

            Feeling nostalgic of random places which you never been before !! <br>

            for every single breath I take, <br>
            for the ability to appreciate colour , fragrance and texture of flowers, <br>
            for the nostalgic afternoon with cool breeze passing through the trees and bird chirps in the background,
            <br>
            for the emotions sprouted by beautiful art or film, <br>
            and many more things in this beautiful cosmic simulation.

            My heart breaks when I see a common Ukrainian man suffers in the war. My heart breaks when I see young
            Russian
            soldiers captured by enemy. <br>
            My heart breaks when I see innocent animals suffering in the war. My heart breaks when two human beings
            fight
            each other. </p>

            Watching everlasting white phalaenopsis bloom, <br>
            petting a stray cat, <br>
            admiring the beauty of dead yellow flowers on the dark blue concrete, <br>
            listening to post-rock musics, <br>
            when days feels like a minutes, <br>
            when night feels longer than the day, <br>
            weird dreams in the night bridging the gap between day and night, <br>
            watching the past with guilt and watching the future with dread
            and watching the time pass-by helplessly <br>
            sigh !!

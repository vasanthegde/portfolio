        I fell in love with Rust and it's compiler <br>
        I love the idea of borrowing and ownership. And the fact that you cannot have both mutable and immutable
        reference to given object simultaneously makes concurrent programming safe. <br>
        Rust compiler messages are so helpful and even it draws ascii lines to suggest where the code needs to fixed.
        <br>
        You can sleep well during night, once you ship your code to prod. <br>
        Though I dislike convoluted types like this one HashMap&lt;u32, Vec&lt;Box&lt;dyn MyTrait&gt;&gt;&gt; sometimes.

        Simple CLI tool for your git add command. <br>
        The main problem with "git add" command is it need complete file path which is bit annoying. Hence this tiny CLI
        wrapper which takes shorthand or simple file names as input and executes git add command to matching unstaged
        files. No need to remember any keyboard shortcuts.
